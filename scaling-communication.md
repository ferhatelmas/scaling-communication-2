# Scaling Communication

Bringing efficiency into our communication tools and patterns.

--

## Agenda

* Internal Complexity
* Review of tools
* Deficiencies
* Use-case
* Improvements

## Estimation

* No clear requirements
* Best-case scenario
* Other things on the plate that aren't counted
* Impossibility of debugging estimation
* Management pressure

--

## Academia vs Learning

> Academia is prestigious because of its association with the noble cause of intellectual rigor and reason. However, too often individuals privileged with an excellent education confuse intelligence with aggressive arrogance. In an ideal world, the best ideas win, and everyone is happy.

--

## Academia vs Learning 2

> But when a workplace environment becomes a battle of the brightest mind, team and individual morale are too often undermined by people overcompensating for weaknesses with a series of tactics that directly or indirectly aim to make their coworkers feel stupid.
